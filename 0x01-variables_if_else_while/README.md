This readme contails details on all the programs in the 0x01-variables_if_else_while directory. 0-positive_or_negative.c: Program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program The output of the program should be: The number, followed by if the number is greater than 0: is positive if the number is 0: is zero if the number is less than 0: is negative followed by a new line

1-last_digit.c: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

You can find the source code here The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code The output of the program should be: The string Last digit of, followed by n, followed by the string is, followed by if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5 if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0 if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0 followed by a new line

2-print_alphabet.c: prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) All your code should be in the main function You can only use putchar twice in your code

3-print_alphabets.c: prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) All your code should be in the main function You can only use putchar three times in your code

4-print_alphabt.c: prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Print all the letters except q and e You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) All your code should be in the main function You can only use putchar twice in your code

5-print_numbers.c: Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6-print_numberz.c: prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

You are not allowed to use any variable of type char You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) You can only use putchar twice in your code

7-print_tebahpla.c: Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

8-print_base16.c: prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

9-print_comb.c: prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space Numbers should be printed in ascending order You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) All your code should be in the main function You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

100-print_comb3.c: Prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

Numbers must be separated by ',,' followed by a space The two digits must be different 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1 Print only the smallest combination of two digits Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits Using only the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden).

101-print_comb4.c prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

Numbers are separated by ',,' followed by a space The three digits must be different 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2 Print only the smallest combination of three digits Numbers are printed in ascending order, with three digits Using only the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)

102-print_comb5.c: prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

The numbers should range from 0 to 99 The two numbers should be separated by a space All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01 The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1 Only using the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) Only using putchar eight times maximum in the code Without using any variable of type char
